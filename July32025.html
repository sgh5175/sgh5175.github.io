        <h3>
            Now that I have your attention with that earworm for the day, let’s talk about what the statement means in
            the world of technology. In this day and age, we all know how to collaborate. If you didn’t know how to
            before the pandemic, you learned rather quickly during it with all the virtual meetings you were probably
            forced to participate in at the time. But what does it mean to collaborate, and are you an actual partner in
            the collaborations you sit through?
            <p></p>
            In the technology world, collaboration is a huge part of your day. It literally means to work jointly with
            others on an activity to create something. So, whether you are discussing things during your standup with
            the team or are a member of a tech team working with a Developer, QA, BA, or PM on a specific instance that
            has come up, you are always collaborating. Many times, in the world of methodologies, you may be
            over-collaborating.
            <p></p>
            What do I mean by that? We are asked as a technology group to create, test, and release in such a manner
            with short, iterative developments that lead to fast returns. The problem with this is that we get bogged
            down in meetings to discuss how we are going to handle the newest creation. For instance, say the business
            side of things had an idea, wanted it out quickly, thought it shouldn’t take that long to do, and needed it
            in a week. Does this sound familiar to anyone? If not, consider yourself lucky. If so, then you probably
            know where I am going with this. Yes, there were requirements, yes, there was an end goal, but they would
            forget the fact that developers aren’t business. That is not their job. Their job is to bring your vision to
            life, but when you are not abundantly clear on your objectives, the collaboration will fall short of the
            expectations.
            <p></p>
            I once worked to create an app with a PM, BA, two QA Automation Engineers, and twelve Developers. There were
            requirements, it was vetted thoroughly, we went through a process I had never had the privilege to work
            through before, and it was amazing to watch and participate in, but it failed miserably. Why, you ask?
            Because there were key components about this app process that were not vetted by the development team,
            because they didn’t understand the business side of what was trying to be accomplished. When I would talk to
            them and say that something wasn’t working correctly, I would hear the dreaded statement, “Well, it works on
            my phone,” and my internal screaming process would begin. Why? Because they weren’t listening to me.
            Listening is a skill that has to be practiced, and let’s face it, we in tech live in a world of deadlines,
            and sometimes the listening part of our job falls to the wayside. That is never more apparant than when too
            much collaboration is occuring. Not intentionally, but because we are working out in our head a specific
            issue we found right before a meeting started, so we stop listening to what essentially boils down to the
            same thing we hear from our team every day.
            <p></p>
            Agile is great in theory, but it bogs you down in repetitive meetings that may not be conducive to your
            deadlines. To be truly agile, why do you have to have three meetings about a sprint? I don’t particularly
            need to know why a sprint went bad or good. It was either a success, or it failed. Instead, while creating
            the next sprint, why are we not discussing why we need more time on a particular user story? This would move
            the needle forward while creating the sprint at the same time. With that type of planning, we just saved
            another day and another one to two-hour meeting that we could use to actually complete our sprints. Another
            prime example, unless you have a scrum master timing you and moving you along, why are your five-minute
            standups lasting an hour a day? This happened to me on that project, and guess what happened? I stopped
            listening. The ramifications of when I stopped collaborating and listening were that things got worse. As a
            QA, I knew what the end user was going to need to accomplish. I also knew because I understood the business and
            what they were trying to accomplish. But I had other duties and other user stories that needed to be
            completed, and therefore I stopped listening to the daily standups so I wouldn’t fall behind on my duties.
            <p></p>
            As a QA, my job is to understand what is being accomplished with the technology and how it will be used by
            the user, whether it is the company itself or an end user. When you drown out my voice, you are drowning out
            the person who will be using the product. I am a neurodivergent thinker, and hyperfocus is the name of my
            game. When you throw me in meetings that last too long and hold no end value, you will lose my complete
            focus and my ability to think outside your box. Minimize the collaboration times, and people like me, and
            there are a lot of us in tech, will listen more and collaborate better.
