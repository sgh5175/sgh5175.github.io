        <h1 style="padding-bottom: 0;">Breaking Software, Building Quality: My Life in QA</h1>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 0;">May 8, 2025</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>I've taken the opportunity to reflect on my role as a Quality Assurance professional, how I contribute to a
            company and its technology team, what drew me to QA in the first place, and whether I truly enjoy what I do.
            The answer is a resounding yes. I love my job as a QA. My curiosity for how software works, paired with a
            drive to uncover issues others may not see, keeps me engaged. I enjoy thinking outside the box to find edge
            cases and break software in ways that might not have been anticipated by developers or users.
            <p></p>
            My attention to detail and analytical mindset has occasionally frustrated developers, especially when
            requirements weren't fully fleshed out, but in the end, it led to better, more resilient software. I was
            raised with the principle to always leave things better than I found them. That principle guides my work
            every day.
            <p></p>
            For the past six years, I’ve worked at a startup where I’ve gained a deep understanding of how software is
            built and maintained, and more importantly, how it serves users. I’ve learned to approach QA not just as a
            tester, but as an advocate for quality, usability, and the people behind the screens.
            <p></p>
            QA isn’t just about testing to meet the requirements, it’s about testing how the business will really use
            the
            software. A developer might not click the same button 15 times, hit the back button, then click it again,
            but
            a user might. And unless a QA Automation Engineer has done manual testing, they may not think to build tests
            for these scenarios up front.
            <p></p>
            Here’s how I approach various types of testing:
            <p></p>
            <li style="padding: 30px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">○ Regression Testing:</b> I build comprehensive test
                suites that examine every feature from multiple security levels. Just because a function works for one
                user role doesn’t mean it should be accessible, or even visible, to all roles. Ensuring that permissions
                and feature integrity are maintained is a top priority.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 30px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">○ Smoke Testing:</b> After any deployment, I perform
                a high-level check of critical functions to ensure stability. If the core of the software is intact,
                then sanity testing can
                proceed.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 30px;">
                <b style="font-size: 20px;">○ Sanity Testing:</b> I verify that recent bug fixes haven’t introduced new
                issues and that existing functionality remains intact.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 30px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">○ Unit Testing:</b> I look at features in isolation,
                ensuring the UI, functionality, APIs, links, and security hold up. For form-based features, I test for
                SQL injections to protect the system and its users.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 30px;"><b style="font-size: 20px;">○ Integration Testing:</b> This is where my business
                logic testing begins. If a feature isn’t intuitive or usable for me, how can we expect end users to
                succeed with it?
            </li>
            <p></p>

            Quality Assurance is more than just a job title, it's a mindset. It’s about taking pride in the details,
            advocating for the user, and being a reliable voice between developers and stakeholders. Every test I
            perform, every bug I log, and every conversation I have with a developer is part of a larger goal: building
            software that is not only functional but exceptional. I’m proud to be a QA, and I look forward to continuing
            to grow in this field, helping teams deliver better software and stronger user experiences every step of the
            way.
