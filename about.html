            <h4>First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Throughout my life, I’ve worn
                many hats: dental assistant, office manager, customer service representative, technical support
                specialist, and now, Software QA Engineer. But the roles I’m most proud of are being a wife for nearly
                20 years and a mother of two. I started my family young and made the conscious choice to wait until my
                children were grown and in college before beginning my own higher education journey.
                <p></p>
                Learning has always been a passion of mine, but I wanted to dedicate those early years to being fully
                present for my kids and giving them the best foundation possible. Once they were thriving on their own
                paths, I finally pursued mine. I enrolled in college before the pandemic and despite the challenges that
                came with those years, including working 60+ hours a week, I graduated with a 3.39 GPA, made the Dean’s
                List multiple semesters, and earned two ISTQB certifications. It’s proof that with determination and
                heart, it’s never too late to follow your dreams.
                <p></p>
                I have been fortunate to work with wonderful people throughout my career, and I hope my next venture
                will be just as rewarding. I am a naturally happy, positive person who is always willing to lend a hand,
                even when it falls outside of my job description. In my last two roles, I was actively involved with the
                company’s culture committee, which I saw as an ambassador role, an opportunity to help ensure that
                everyone feels valued and included. I believe every individual should be seen, heard, and represented,
                especially in today’s world of remote work where connection and inclusion matter more than ever.
                <p></p>
                If you are looking for a new team member and believe I could be a valuable addition to your team, please
                feel free to contact me through one of the links in the footer below. I will respond as soon as
                possible.
