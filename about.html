        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Throughout my life, I’ve worn many
            hats: dental assistant, office manager, customer service representative, technical support specialist, and
            now, Software QA Engineer. But the roles I’m most proud of are being a wife for nearly 20 years and a mother
            of two. I started my family young and made the conscious choice to wait until my children were grown and in
            college before beginning my own higher education journey. Learning has always been a passion of mine, but I
            wanted to dedicate those early years to being fully present for my kids and giving them the best foundation
            possible. Once they were thriving on their own paths, I finally pursued mine. I enrolled in college before
            the pandemic and despite the challenges that came with those years, including working 60+ hours a week, I
            graduated with a 3.39 GPA, made the Dean’s List multiple semesters, and earned two ISTQB certifications.
            It’s proof that with determination and heart, it’s never too late to follow your dreams.<p></p>
            I have been fortunate to work with wonderful people throughout my career, and I hope my next venture will be
            just as rewarding. I am a naturally happy, positive person who is always willing to lend a hand, even when
            it falls outside of my job description. In my last two roles, I was actively involved with the company’s
            culture committee, which I saw as an ambassador role, an opportunity to help ensure that everyone feels
            valued and included. I believe every individual should be seen, heard, and represented, especially in
            today’s world of remote work where connection and inclusion matter more than ever.<p></p>
            If you are looking for a new team member and believe I could be a valuable addition to your team, please
            feel free to contact me through <a href="contact.html">this link</a>. I will respond as soon as possible.
