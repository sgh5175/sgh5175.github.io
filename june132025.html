        <h3>
            This is a question we all anticipate in an interview, and as someone currently navigating this journey, I’ve
            spent time reflecting on exactly why I am the right hire and why I still bring deep passion to my role as a
            QA Engineer.
            <p></p>
            What excites me most about a career in QA is the constant evolution. Technology is always changing, and
            working in this space means being a lifelong learner. You must love learning and have a genuine desire to
            build things that not only function well but genuinely improve people’s experiences, whether simplifying a
            daily task or providing a grand adventure in a game. What drew me to QA in the first place was being an end
            user myself, frustrated by software that didn’t live up to its promise of making life easier.
            <p></p>
            If you’ve worked at a company that once earned a harsh review, I’ll be honest it might have been me. I have
            little patience for poor quality or lack of care for the user experience. When a company repeatedly shows me
            that they don’t prioritize quality, I walk away. And I often leave feedback. Because the user experience
            matters, and I care deeply about it.
            <p></p>
            Deadlines and releases are part of the job, we all know that. But quality should never be an afterthought.
            QA needs to be embedded in every step of the software lifecycle, not just brought in at the end. Even during
            my time in tech support, I felt the thrill of catching issues early, of being respected (and maybe even a
            little feared!) by developers when I came to their desk with a bug or concern. That mutual respect has been
            a constant motivator throughout my 20-year career.
            <p></p>
            One of my favorite moments is when an idea pops into my head and I run to the lead developer and say, “Hey
            do you think this is possible? I’ve been doing this manually every day, and it’s driving me nuts.”
            Collaborating to bring that idea to life, watching the light bulb go off in their head, is energizing. Those
            are the moments that remind me why I love what I do.
            <p></p>
            I’m currently learning more about automation because it’s the next natural step in my journey. But make no
            mistake, I proudly call myself a QA Engineer. That title reflects my belief that QA isn’t a phase, it’s a
            presence throughout the entire product lifecycle, from idea to deprecation.
            <p></p>
            I’m a creative soul with a technical mind. I bring curiosity, a user-first mentality, and a deep sense of
            ownership to every project I work on. I champion the end user, and I believe no one is better suited to
            guide them on their journey than the person who ensures the software is functional, reliable, and usable.
