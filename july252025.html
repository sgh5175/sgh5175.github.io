        <h1 style="padding-bottom: 0;">Breaking the Myth: QA is Not Just Bug Hunting</h1>
        <h2 style="padding-top: 0;">July 25, 2025</h2>

        <h3>
            I will confess, when I first started hearing the word QA many moons ago, this is what I thought QA did as
            well. Hear about the bug, investigate the bug, confirm or deny it is a bug, tell the developer to fix it,
            and then test the fix to ensure the bug was gone and did not break anything else. At the time, I lived in
            the world of insurance software. We rolled out new versions of the software every four years or so, and even
            then the basic functionality did not change. More often, the framework behind the scenes did. So when I
            started teaching myself the more important processes and learning the fundamentals that are truly QA, I
            giggled at my initial thoughts.
            <p></p>
            Over the years, QA methodologies have grown, adapted, shifted, and evolved, but the fundamentals remain the
            same. Our purpose is to ensure quality across the board as best we can, making sure the end user has an
            enjoyable experience with the software we touch. This is a principle that all developers and QA
            professionals should carry as well. However, too often the focus remains on requirements instead. A human is
            not a requirement. They are a living, breathing entity who ebbs and flows from day to day in how they think,
            how they move, and how they use software.
            <p></p>
            Case in point, I may normally have the patience to click a button once and wait, but on another day I might
            go to a site I have used a thousand times, and in my frustration, click the button a million times because
            it does not respond as quickly as I expect. In doing so, I may inadvertently break something because no one
            tested for that scenario.
            <p></p>
            I have visited websites where I cringed, knowing that I have many color blind friends who would struggle
            with distinguishing button differences. To make matters worse, I have seen buttons arranged in ways that are
            reversed from any other site I have ever used. In situations like this, users may waste valuable time
            filling out a form incorrectly or even cancel a purchase that wipes out their entire cart. When these
            oversights occur, you do not just lose customer confidence. You lose revenue.
            <p></p>
            True QA is about so much more than hunting bugs. It is about thinking like the user, anticipating their
            needs, understanding their frustrations, and ensuring that the software serves them well. It is about
            preventing problems before they happen, not just fixing them after the fact. When QA professionals embrace
            this mindset, we are not just testers. We are advocates for every single person who will touch that product.
            And that is where the real value of QA lives.
