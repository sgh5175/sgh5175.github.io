        <h3>
            If you have ever watched the British sitcom “The IT Crowd,” you probably laughed the first time you heard
            the character Roy speak this infamous line. If you have ever stated this phrase to someone, chances are you
            work in tech. In my career, I have said this phrase so many times that I have lost count. In my last
            position alone, I repeated that line and “Have you cleared your cache and restarted your browser?” so often
            that anyone coming to me with an issue would start by saying, “I cleared my cache and restarted my browser,
            and when that didn’t work, I restarted my computer. I need you to look at it.”
            <p></p>
            The “it” in that statement could have been several things. From hardware to software issues, whether
            involving our proprietary systems or off-the-shelf solutions, I was that go-to person for my team—and I
            enjoyed it. I chose tech as my career because I have a passion for learning. Exploring new concepts, new
            software, and new hardware is genuinely fun for me. One of the first things I learned is that a good search
            engine is your best friend. We are often expected to have all the answers, and often, the answer is
            something that could be found with a quick search. But instead, they trust you and come to you, and that’s a
            good thing. It means the human component in tech is still valued and valuable.
            <p></p>
            The “have you turned it off and back on again” line is a tried-and-true method for resetting a device and
            clearing temporary glitches. When we ask that, it is not a brush-off or a joke, it’s a way to determine if
            the issue is temporary or something that requires deeper investigation. This technique works for hardware,
            software, and anything with memory capacity, like your laptop, phone, television, and sometimes even your
            smart lightbulbs.
            <p></p>
            So just remember, you may roll your eyes when we say it, but we are here to support you. It’s what we signed
            up for, even when we sound like a broken record.
