        <h3>
            This week came with a range of emotions, as it is my last week with guaranteed unemployment benefits in an
            economy that is not exactly friendly to tech workers—unless you’ve done the job for, well, a gazillion
            years. With that in mind, I shifted the focus of my job search to include not only QA roles, but also
            Technical Support positions.
            <p></p>
            Before I worked in QA, I spent years in technical support, and I was good at it. And while no one enjoys
            taking a step back in their career, a job is a job at this point in the game.
            Here’s what I’ve found over the past few months of applying: if a company doesn’t list a salary for a job,
            it’s probably not worth applying. Either a) you’ll want too much for a role they can’t afford, or b) they’ve
            got a big budget but are trying to see how low they can go. That’s fine, businesses care about their bottom
            line, but here’s the catch. I’ve undercut myself when applying to jobs I know I’m a good fit for, even when
            the pay is significantly less than what I know I’m worth.
            <p></p>
            Why? Because I’m not looking for a short-term role to tide me over until something better comes along. I’m
            looking for a role that lets me grow and challenges me.
            <p></p>
            This week, I was denied an interview after stating my salary expectations. I gave a number that was low
            compared to my QA salary, but still fair for someone with over 12 years of tech support experience. It was a
            stable company offering a low-level QA tech support job, so I saw only one direction to go, up. Up in pay,
            up in title, and up in experience. I wanted to help move the needle forward for both potentially myself and
            the company where I completed the application.
            <p></p>
            But they didn’t even come back with, “Hey, you look great on paper, but our budget is this, would you still
            be interested?” Other companies I have had the pleasure of interviewing with have done it. If they had said
            that, even if their number was $15K less than what I put down, I would have said yes. It still would have
            been enough for me to live my life.
            <p></p>
            The interview process is hard enough to break into, but when you ask candidates what they expect to be paid
            without giving any kind of guidance, you set us up to fail—even if we’re the perfect fit for you. Of course,
            we’ll try to get what we think we deserve based on the job description. Of course, we’ll try to get close to
            our value without completely undercutting ourselves. But if you don’t give us any idea of your salary range,
            you leave us stuck—jobless and hopeless.
            <p></p>
            An ideal job posting, at least for me, includes one number. Not a range. Just one number. Lowball it if you
            must, if I or anyone else thinks we can make it work, we’ll apply. That weeds out candidates who wouldn’t
            normally be a fit and helps you find the ones who are.
