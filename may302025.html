        <h3 style="padding-top: 15px;">Layoffs are never easy. They bring uncertainty, self-doubt, and a momentary pause
            in momentum. But for those
            of us in Quality Assurance, where adaptability and attention to detail are second nature, it's also an
            opportunity to reflect, reset, and recharge with purpose.
            <p></p>
            Here’s how I have spent my time post-layoff—and I hope it might inspire others navigating a similar phase:
        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <h4>1. Upskilling with Intention</h4>
        <h3>The tech world never stops evolving, and neither have I. I have lived in the fast-paced world of startup
            franchising for the past six years and I’ll admit I neglected my continual learning practices after I
            graduated in 2023, for no other reason than I was tired and needed a break from learning new concepts and
            tools. I have since begun revisiting core testing principles and added new tools to my QA toolkit. I
            completed online courses in:</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>○ API testing with Postman</li>
            <li>○ Automated testing using Selenium and Cypress (Playwright is next up)</li>
            <li>○ Agile testing and QA metrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>I also brushed up on SQL, started learning JIRA and Salesforce. Why? Because there are so many jobs out
            there that require you to have experience in both for so why not.</h3>
        <h4>2. Reflecting on My QA Journey</h4>
        <h3>For the first time in a while, I had a chance to step back and assess the bigger picture:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>○ What kind of QA work excites me the most?</li>
            <li>○ Which company values align with mine?</li>
            <li>○ What have I learned from past roles that I want to carry forward—or leave behind?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>I used this time to update my portfolio and reframe my resume to better reflect my real impact on past
            projects.</h3>
        <h4>3. Staying Connected</h4>
        <h3>Isolation can be one of the hardest parts of a layoff. I made a point to connect with former colleagues, and
            QA communities, and began following industry leaders on LinkedIn.
            <p></p>
            These connections have not only kept me motivated, they led me to a community I never felt a part of before
            because I didn’t have the time.
        </h3>
        <h4>4. Practicing Self-Care</h4>
        <h3>Sometimes, the best thing you can do is rest. I made time for exercise, sleep, hobbies, and mental health. I
            am a workaholic by nature, and this reminded me that my value isn’t tied to a job title—and that I’m not
            alone.</h3>
        <h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>
        <h3>A layoff can feel like a full stop, but it doesn’t have to be. For QA professionals, it’s a chance to
            iterate, improve, and come back stronger. If you’re navigating your own post-layoff period, know that you
            are not alone in this journey and give yourself the time and space to grow and reflect. The right
            opportunity will come—and you'll be more than ready when it does.</h3>
        </h3>
