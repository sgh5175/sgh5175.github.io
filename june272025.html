        <h3>
            This week, as I was finishing up the updates on my personal website to showcase my QA skills, I learned
            quite a bit more than I had forgotten about HTML, which turned out to be a good thing. I realized I still do
            not like div elements because they frustrate me endlessly when testing the site. Thankfully, I know a QA
            person who caught the issues quickly and efficiently after I pushed my changes to production. ðŸ¤£
            As I thought about my goals for the site and the tests I wanted to perform, I felt my passion for QA return.
            I am happy that happened. After being unemployed for six months, I started to wonder if the problem was me
            instead of the job market. But I know it is not me. I love what I do, and I hope my updated portfolio shows
            that clearly.
            <p></p>
            During this time, the hiring process has been very discouraging. You apply for a job that seems perfect, and
            then you hear nothing. Most of the time, there is not even confirmation that your resume was received.
            Applicant tracking systems are flawed and often reflect a lack of expertise when designing the hiring tools.
            I understand they are meant to filter thousands of applications and highlight top candidates quickly.
            However, companies are using AI to write job descriptions and filter the resumes, and they never stop to
            question if the process is working well.
            <p></p>
            Can AI write job descriptions and resumes? Yes, it absolutely can. But should it? I believe AI is best used
            as either a starting point or a final check. That is how I use it, anything I write either begins or ends in
            an AI tool. It is a helpful part of the process. I no longer have an editor like I did during my time at
            Code Ninjas, and I do not want to ask someone else to give up their free time to review my articles. So, I
            write, then use AI to help me refine the work, and finally I go back and make my final edits before sharing
            it. It is important to me that my voice remains clear, not replaced by the voice of a machine.
            <p></p>
            I know I tend to share a lot. Just ask my former coworkers who used to edit the first drafts I wrote for new
            feature documentation. I would write two full sentences to explain what they would later summarize in just a
            few words. I always want people to understand why I am saying something and where I am coming from. If I do
            not explain everything, I might leave out something important. That habit probably comes from how I write
            test cases. I do not assume you know what I want you to do. I clearly explain each step of the test.
            <p></p>
            I have shared thoughts before in previous articles about QA and whether AI will replace us. But this time, I
            want to speak directly to companies. We are still human, and we need human interaction. The pandemic made
            that more obvious than ever. Even for someone like me, who is naturally introverted, it became clear how
            much human connection matters. I can be happy staying home, but if you tell me I am not allowed to leave,
            suddenly that is all I want to do.
            <p></p>
            Technology is similar, it needs human input to grow. AI cannot teach itself to think or feel like a person,
            only people can do that. Even if we one day teach AI to think logically like a person, we will never teach
            it to think irrationally. Irrational thinking is a human trait, and it leads to the kind of creative,
            unexpected ideas that move technology forward. That is one reason why humans will always be a necessary part
            of the tech world.
            <p></p>
            We are a resilient group, AI helps us in many ways, but I hope we are wise enough to avoid the kinds of
            mistakes that science fiction has warned us about for years. And if we do go too far, I hope the developers
            who created AI also created a way to shut it down if needed.
            <p></p>
            If you only use what AI gives you, you lose your voice. This applies to individuals and companies. Make sure
            you read what you are posting. Make sure it fits the job and that the expectations make sense. For example,
            if you post a QA job that is supposed to be for manual testing, do not ask for three years of experience in
            automation development. Write job listings that are clear and reasonable for people, not just written for
            machines to understand. We are more than our resume tells you we are, and if you rely only on keywords and
            filters, you will miss the depth, potential, and passion that a real person brings to the table.
