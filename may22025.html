        <h3>While applying for a Manual QA role recently, I was asked how AI would fit into the QA process and whether
            it would eventually replace my role. Although I gave what I thought was a thoughtful answer, I now realize I
            didn’t fully grasp the question at the time.
            <p></p>
            So, do I think automation and AI will replace manual testers in the future? No, and here’s why.
            <p></p>
            I’m a critical thinker, fascinated by the human brain and all its potential. I enjoy studying people’s
            mannerisms, expressions, and thought processes. As a QA, my goal is to create secure, usable software for
            the very people I find so interesting.
            <p></p>
            Quality and security are vital in any industry, and QAs are the last line of defense. Think of it as
            ensuring the "train" stays on its track and doesn’t veer off course or pick up unexpected passengers.
            <p></p>
            For example, in a previous job, I worked on a website that integrated with our main system to let customers
            manage accounts and make payments. We had clear requirements, followed Agile, and had project managers,
            BAs—all the tools to ensure success.
            <p></p>
            When it was my turn to test, I had a gut feeling something was wrong. The login process seemed fine, but
            when I checked how user accounts were placed in the system, I had concerns. I logged in with my test
            credentials and found I could access sensitive internal notes—something a customer should never see.
            <p></p>
            Thankfully, I flagged this issue, preventing a potential crisis. Why wasn’t it caught earlier? Developers
            weren’t looking at it from a QA perspective—they were focused on the requirements. Automated tests wouldn’t
            have caught this, because it wasn’t in the plan.
            <p></p>
            QA is more than finding bugs. It’s anticipating every scenario that could happen. Just as no two people take
            the same path in life, no two users interact with software the same way. We may make mistakes, but we learn
            from them to improve.
            <p></p>
            Machines, including AI, can only do what they’re programmed to do. AI is helpful, but it’s still limited by
            the data it’s trained on and can only test what’s written. A manual QA role is essential for software teams.
            <p></p>
            AI is a great tool, but human creativity and insight are irreplaceable in QA.
